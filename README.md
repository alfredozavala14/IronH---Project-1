# IronH---Project-1

## Introduction

AS part of the Data Analytics bootcamp in Ironhack, we have weekly projects that allow us to practice what we have learned in class. The objective of this project, the first in the bootcamp, is to practice cleaning a data set, using pandas and using visualization tools.

## Getting Started

We have downloaded a dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks) that includes data on registered shark attacks.

## Hypotheses

To define the data cleaning objectives more clearly, we start by making hypotheses that we would like to test by using the data. That way we know what data we will need and how we have to treat the available data.

First, I hypothesize that the number of attacks have gone down throughout the years. Second, I hypothesize that the type of attack will be correlated with the sex of the victim. Finally, the activity that the victim was doing is correlated with the fatality of the attack.

## Libraries used

During the project, I have used the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Regex
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can find links to the official documentation of each library at the end, under Links & Resources

## Work done

To clean the data, I have used various techniques, including:
- Deleting rows & columns full of null values
- Deleting duplicated data
- Changin data types (eg. string to int) using functions and lambdas
- Grouping data according to visualization needs
- Using regex to substitute strings that should be equal
- Changin column names to make them more 'python firendly' (e.g. removing spaces, special characters, etc.)

## Deliverables

- Deliverables include the cleaned dataset and two jupyter notebooks, one where I carried out the cleaning process and one including the visualization part of the project
